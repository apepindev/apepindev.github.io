    <p class="mb-6">I'm Andrew, and that's me with Gia, the most beautiful and kindest soul whom I'm lucky enough to
        call my wife. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Kamma and I'm having the best time there. I can't ask for more
        where everyday I'm learning something new within a healthy company culture where everyone supports each other,
        all the way from the C-suite down. Life is great!</p>

    <p class="mb-6">I'm primarily a backend PHP/Laravel developer but also work with Python and Node.js. In my spare
        time I like to keep up with the latest software/tech news as well as work on some personal projects and try out
        new languages, frameworks and updates. For leisure, enjoying spending time with Gia, indulging in the playful
        antics of my cats (Remi and Oscar), immersing myself in gaming on my PC (currently hooked on Valorant), and
        jamming along to music on my e-drum conversion kit.</p>
