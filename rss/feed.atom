<p>This is my first of several portfolio/blog sites I’ve created on and off over the years in my
career that has graduated to a public audience. It had been fun using different
languages and frameworks and was a great learning experience, but I was never
completely satisfied in the end result with either of them. They were built on
foundations that were either overkill, awkward to use/work with, or were not rich enough
in features.</p>
<h2>Jigsaw is great<a id="content-jigsaw-is-great" href="#content-jigsaw-is-great" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink">#</a></h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2024 I was glad to have stumbled across <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.com/">Jigsaw</a>. Jigsaw was perfect
for me as it checked a lot of my boxes. I can host this for free on Github Pages, it’s
simple and easy to use and maintain, and also has rich features from the Laravel
framework that I’m very familiar with.</p>
<p>This site started off using <a href="https://github.com/tighten/jigsaw-blog-template">their blog starter template</a>, but I have made some changes.
I’ve “flatten” the overall design, add a light/dark mode toggle, added <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>, and
other miscellaneous changes. Feel free to use the same template here;</p>
